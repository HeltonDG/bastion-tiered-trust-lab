Design Principles

### Bastion-Governed Access
All administrative traffic is required to traverse a hardened RHEL 9 bastion host. Internal servers are not directly reachable from the VPN.

### Network-Enforced Trust Boundaries
pfSense operates as the primary policy enforcement point, ensuring that access between zones is intentional and auditable.

### No Flat VPN
Remote users are never dropped directly into the internal server network.

### Progressive Trust Model
Trust increases gradually as traffic moves inward:

VPN → Firewall → Bastion → Internal Servers

### Forensic Resilience
Logs are forwarded to a centralized logging server to prevent attackers from erasing operational history.
