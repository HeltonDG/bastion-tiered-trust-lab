# Segmentation Strategy

Segmentation is implemented to reduce lateral movement and contain potential compromise.

Key strategies include:

- Bastion-only administrative access
- Isolation of internal servers from direct VPN reachability
- Centralized logging positioned deeper within the trust boundary
- Firewall-enforced policy between tiers

The design favors simplicity while preserving strong security posture.
